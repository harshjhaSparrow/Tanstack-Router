 horizonatal deployment is not here due to multiple people solving bugs.
 figma missing so we arent able to plan how to start and end ,reusable components etc cant be decided....cz padding ,margin ,space etc and theme etc from ui dev perspective ..they are more created and they know how the user will interact ....
 ui prototype is important for demo with client ....... which is incase of figma only not in graphic images we are showing....
 figma dev and then approved by MANAGEMENT and client and once design is done .... then coding implement....
 each dev has its own practices.. so if experienced enough we should let them setup the project and inspiration should be seniors.....
 api testing is important.. then intgration k bad frontend.....vallidation etc shud be done by testor....
 feature then in that same cycle that feature should be tested ....
